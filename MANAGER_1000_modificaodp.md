## Edit Job

In order to change the Job a manager can use different methods depending on the Job’s status.  

If the Job is located in section New jobs, then to edit the Job simply click on it.  

If the Job is located in section "Assigned", subsection "Queue" then manager has to do the following: 
* click on Job
* then click on "Edit" button on the top left side of the Job

* confirm that he wants to edit the Job. Please note, by clicking on "OK" button the Job will be moved away from the queue and will not be processed in manufacturing. From now on the Job is in the editing mode and is located in the section "New jobs"
or  
* Cancel operation by clicking on "Cancel” button.

### Important

* All Jobs which are being processed in production (located in section "Work in progress") can not be edited. To edit them please await when the respective manufacturing stage will be finished.
* When manager finishes editing please note that the Job has to be put into queue again, so it will be allocated to production (see “Put into the queue”).
