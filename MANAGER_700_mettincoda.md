## Put into the queue

### Into

Button "Put in queue" allows to put Job into queue for production.

This button is active in the following cases: 
* manager opens Job from New jobs section
* manager creates new Job
* manager edits Job which has been already put in the queue (section Assigned)

Job which has been put into queue from now on will be located in section "Assigned" (see "Assigned"). Job which has not been put into the queue remains in section "New jobs" with heading "Assign..." to remind managers.
