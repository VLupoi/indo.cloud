*User manual for Managers of production processes*

## Introduzione

### MES system for Managers of production processes
MES systems (Manufacturing Execution System) - are systems (software) which are located between ERP and Scada/PLC systems and which perform collection of tactical data directly from work stations (machine, working area, workshop) in order to help management to understand how current production processes can be optimized.

MES can help to track and optimize production logistics within the factory. MES provides online tools to operators and guarantees to management monitoring of the following key indicators: 
* productivity of workshops 
* time spent and quantitative production costs    

MES helps to receive live data about production progress (time and quantity of manufactured products) and thus control the production process. This in turn is an important element in management of critical situations and decision making in relation to: 
* alerts
* machinery emergency stops
* malfunctioning of equipment

With MES it is possible to reveal and reduce bottlenecks on the work floor, reduce waste and therefore increase production effectiveness. 

### Advantages of digitalization 
In Industry 4.0 epoch it is important to transform the data from MES systems into useful information. Agile Factory is the tool that is able to add value to the production data and present this data to management for decision making.

True organisational revolution of production processes starts when different MES functions collaborate: 
* Automatic data collection
* Powerful control possibilities 
* Processes monitoring

Production management (top management, workshop managers, stewarts and quality control managers) can in live mode observe production process, resourcesâ€™ statuses, effectiveness of work stations and optimize any production process.
