## Job priority

### Intro
Job priority goes from top to down. System automatically assigns priority to Jobs based on FIFO method: First in First out.

### FIRST IN FIRST OUT

This method assigns to the first Job highest priority. Job with the highest priority is always showed on the top of the list. This job will be processed before the others on a station to which it has been assigned to. Each new Job will get lower priority. The last Job in the queue will have the lowest priority and will be located in the bottom of the list and will be processed the last.

### Changing priority

Manager can change the priority which has been assigned to a Job by the System. To do so just change place of the Job in the queue.

To change the priority click on the Job and hold left button of the mouse, then move the Job to the desired position in the list. This will change the Job's priority.

#### Important

Changing a Jobâ€™s position upper in the list will increase the Job's priority. And vice versa, moving a Job down in the list will decrease the Job's priority.
