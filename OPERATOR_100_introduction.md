*Operator's interface*
  
## Intro
This manual describes basics of operator's interaction with equipment which is the most important element of Industry 4.0.

### Job's Management Execution System by Operator (MES)  
MES (Manufacturing Execution System) is the System that operates with live information and provides opportunity to manage, control and optimize operations in different stages of production: from receipt of production order (hereinafter "Job") to final product. Agile Factory MES collects live data from work stations (terminals, production stations, equipment) and provides opportunity to control Job flow over the whole factory.

### Interface of operator (HMI)   
Interface of operator HMI (Human Machine Interface) is a monitor which enables cooperation between operator and MES. HMI installed on station provides an opportunity to collect data from station and to feed production data into the System.

Having HMI removes the need to:
* Read and present production data on paper (material receipt, setup, production chart etc);
* Fill in manually productivity data at the end of the shift to consolidate for management/accounting;
* To remember/note how many products or semi-finished products where produced.

HMI presents everything that is needed for production, especially:
* which Jobs has been received (Job, operation, quantities)
* documents which has to be used during production

Moreover, operator can inform management about any possible problems.

### Advantages of digitalisation
Digitalisation of information provides convenience and swiftness of actions and decision, provides optimisation and control over production processes. At the end, it helps reduce costs of time and resources and provides an opportunity to produce hight quality products.
